		"descriptionFull":"<p>The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Spirit was launched on June 10, 2003 from Cape Canaveral on a Delta &#8545; rocket. It's main goal was to search for clues to past water activity on Mars. </p><p>After liftoff and boost, the vehicle was inserted into a circular \"parking orbit\", after which the NASA executed the necessary maneuvers to send the spacecraft on a trajectory to Mars. After separation of the launch vehicle, acquisition by the Deep Space Network (DSN), a series of inspections, and a few post-launch commands, the spacecraft entered it's \"cruise\" stage.</p><p>During cruise, the spacecraft spins 2 rpm. Not much is done during the cruise stage; the only actions by NASA are a few health checks and some calibration and corrections. Cruise ends 45 days from entry into the Martian atmosphere. At that time, the approach stage begins. </p><p>In the approach stage, the engineers begin preparations for the entry, descent, and landing stage. The mission team makes three more correction maneuvers, and perform frequent \"Delta DOR\" measurements to ensure accurate delivery. Once the spacecraft reaches the Martian atmosphere, the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) stage begins. There are five steps to EDL (taken directly from NASA's website): <ol><li>An aeroshell and a parachute decelerate the lander through the martian atmosphere.</li><li>Prior to surface impact, retro-rockets are fired to slow the landerÂ´s speed of descent, and airbags are inflated to cushion the lander at surface impact.</li><li>After its initial impact, the lander bounces along the martian surface until it rolls to a stop.</li><li>The airbags are then deflated and retracted, and the lander petals and rover egress aids are deployed.</li><li>Once the petals have opened, the rover deploys its solar arrays, and places the system in a safe state.</li></ol></p><p>Both Spirit and it's twin Opportunity carry a Panoramic Camera, a Thermal Emission Spectrometer, a M&Ouml;ssbauer Spectrometer, an Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer, Magnets, a Microscopic Imager, and a Rock Abrasion Tool. </p><p>The goal for each rover was to drive a total of 1 kilometer (about &frac34; of a mile). Spirit lasted 6 years, dying on March 22, 2010. It had traveled 7.73 kilometers (4.8 miles).</p>",

It held a pilot and two passengers.

SpaceShipOne flew in space for about 3 minutes, before coming back to Earth.</p><p>SpaceShipOne made 17 flights over its lifetime. Although it served no real purpose, it was the basis for SpaceShipTwo, the second version of the spacecraft. But mostly it is remembered as the first private spacecraft in the history of spaceflight. </p>",

The entire process enabled NASA to succesfully land the 2,000 lbs (900 kg) Curiosity safely on Mars without damaging any components.</p><p>Word of the touchdown was transmitted to Earth via NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter. After landing, Curiosity's job is to explore the surrounding area and try to determine if Mars is, or ever was, capable of supporting microbial life. Curiosity mission was estimated to last roughly two earth years. As of today it is still operating. </p>",
